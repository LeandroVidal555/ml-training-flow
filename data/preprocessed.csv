* need backtesting framework to iterate on prompts and agentic workflows to make sure we're always competitive. Need to experiment across foundational models to quantify where you're at to improve


* did enjoy open source frameworks - langchain - most of them will be too brittle and build abstractions on top of - example langchain is brittle because optimized for speed to spin up. As a result - different parts of the stack is less accessible for tuning. Example - chat history libraries didn't let them use conditional logic what you would/wouldn't want to maintain in memory. so had to replace that in the library. library repo is super hard and too many abstractions.

"I just met with Dan Berger at the Medfield Griddle. I was connected to him from Rob Hallion from YPO. Rob's wife, I think, was a maid of honor at Dan Berger's wedding. Dan's wife went to HBS and was obviously very connected through there and knew Rob's wife from there as well, I think. Dan also knows a guy who has a box company. ...boxes for things like Tideless golf balls and stuff like that. Dan is the founder of Golf Mind and Body, which is a really cool app for fitness around golf.Dan is looking to raise more money for the golf app.",0

"Dan Miller True Search
Based in Lower Haight, SF, California
Been there for many years
Built their Venture Capital VC partner practice


Spent a year at Paradigm focused on crypto investments. Had Sam Bankman Fried on an LP conference two weeks before FTX collapsed. Financial loss to Paradigm was not terrible, they were a major investor in FTX.


Village Global (Reid Hoffman is Chairman) focused on early stage. Just raised $250MM round. Preseed, seed primarily. Also write checks as LPs into other small funds. Give people super scout allocations ($2MM). Lean team w/ 4 investors, 2 of which are operators. No one on team is former VC. Consummate networkers. Willing to write checks of any size. Not YC in terms of number of companies. They are most competitive with first round.


Looking for a full time partner, separately an Investor In Residence - get to know before full time as part time person. Just placed one person there and looking to find another. Judgement of founder type, product idea, that kind of thing.


Other firm is Quiet Capital - they are more under the radar. Two entrepreneurs - Matt Humphry and Lee Lindon (TapJoy) sold their companies and became active angels. Through that they started a firm to scale their angel investments. Current fund is 4th with $450MM. 5 investors on the team and robust network of venture partners (37) scouts exclusive to Quiet, previously funded by Quiet. Venture Partners get economics in the deal - that's how they source 60% of their deals. They have scout/VP program, also looking for a full time partner. Looking for enterprise, infrastructure, AI.

* Conrad lives in Lake Tahoe, grew up in Marin and lived in the bay area until Covid and then moved to Tahoe during Covid


* He knows Art from his time at McKinsey & Company. Art and Elephant Ventures were helping his team develop digital practice


* Conrad has been working with a company called Ridgeline that does institutional asset management company. Sibling of Workday conceptually with similar playbook. He has been helping them build a partner ecosystem.


* Conrad is considering moving to a blockchain stablecoin (Circle). The role would be a partner ecosystem around private venture capital. DNA is not web3 but hasn't started learning about crypto. Surprised by how quickly the conversations went. Conrad has done agile strategy work with similar places. Needs to do more diligence on circle and USDC.


* Job is really about using VCs as a channel to ensure startups are using USDC and their surrounding products. Job is not about getting VCs to adopt themselves.


* Tether is now over $100B float, Circle is around $33B and Tether lead is growing.",0

"SLA confirmation email
From: Naina Manglani <naina.manglani@truckistan.pk>
Date: Mon, 19 Jun 2023 at 1:24 pm
Subject: SLAs and system correction for different shipping options
To: Salman Akram <salman.akram@truckistan.pk>
Cc: Zafar Khan <zafar.khan@truckistan.pk>, Abid Butt <abid.butt@truckistan.pk>, rao.talha <rao.talha@truckistan.pk>, Shahid Rizvi <shahid.rizvi@truckistan.pk>, Anjum Shahzad <anjum.shahzad@truckistan.pk>, Farhan Haider <farhan.haider@truckistan.pk>




Dear Salman,


I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to follow up on our previous conversation and provide you with the Service Level Agreements (SLAs) for our different shipping options. Please find the details below:


ECO Service:
The SLA for this service is calculated by adding one day to the time frame provided to the customer.
The pickup day will not be counted in the specific hours given to the customer.
For example, if a shipment is picked up on the 19th of the month at 1:00 PM from KHI-LHR, the SLA would start from the 20th and end on the 24th. The delivery date would be the 24th, and any delivery after the 24th would be considered a delay.
Express Service:
Similar to the ECO service, the SLA for Express service also adds one day to the given time frame.
The pickup day is not included in the hours given to the customer.
For instance, if a shipment is picked up on the 19th of the month at 1:00 PM from KHI-LHR, the SLA would start from the 20th and end on the 22nd. The delivery date would be the 22nd, and any delivery after the 22nd would be considered a delay.
Urgent Service:
For urgent shipments, such as KHI-LHR, the SLA is set at 32 hours.
In this case, the SLA time starts from the moment our vehicle leaves the customer's premises. For example, if the shipment is picked up at 1:00 PM and our vehicle departs at 2:00 PM, the SLA time will start from 2:00 PM.
If the shipment arrives after the 32-hour timeframe, it will be considered late.
Please take note of the following points:


Urgent Customer to Customer Shipments: Please note that the SLA for urgent customer to customer shipments will be different from the standard SLAs mentioned earlier. However, for now, I will provide you with the details for Swyft.


Pickup Date Timeframe: The pickup date for all shipments begins from 12:00 midnight and extends until 11:59 PM. Please ensure that the pickup is scheduled within this time frame",0
