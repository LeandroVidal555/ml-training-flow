I wanted to follow up on our previous conversation and provide you with the Service Level Agreements (SLAs) for our different shipping options. Please find the details below:\\n\\n\\nECO Service:\\nThe SLA for this service is calculated by adding one day to the time frame provided to the customer.\\nThe pickup day will not be counted in the specific hours given to the customer.\\nFor example, if a shipment is picked up on the 19th of the month at 1:00 PM from KHI-LHR, the SLA would start from the 20th and end on the 24th. The delivery date would be the 24th, and any delivery after the 24th would be considered a delay.\\nExpress Service:\\nSimilar to the ECO service, the SLA for Express service also adds one day to the given time frame.\\nThe pickup day is not included in the hours given to the customer.\\nFor instance, if a shipment is picked up on the 19th of the month at 1:00 PM from KHI-LHR, the SLA would start from the 20th and end on the 22nd. The delivery date would be the 22nd, and any delivery after the 22nd would be considered a delay.\\nUrgent Service:\\nFor urgent shipments, such as KHI-LHR, the SLA is set at 32 hours.\\nIn this case, the SLA time starts from the moment our vehicle leaves the customer's premises. For example, if the shipment is picked up at 1:00 PM and our vehicle departs at 2:00 PM, the SLA time will start from 2:00 PM.\\nIf the shipment arrives after the 32-hour timeframe, it will be considered late.\\nPlease take note of the following points:\\n\\n\\nUrgent Customer to Customer Shipments: Please note that the SLA for urgent customer to customer shipments will be different from the standard SLAs mentioned earlier. However, for now, I will provide you with the details for Swyft.\\n\\n\\nPickup Date Timeframe: The pickup date for all shipments begins from 12:00 midnight and extends until 11:59 PM.
